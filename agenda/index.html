The company operates more than 100 locations worldwide on U.S. Military bases and at stand-alone locations. <br><br>
After deciding to replace an in-house MSSQL/VB lead management solution, MAS made the choice to move to a web-based platform that supports an integrated mobile solution. The goal was to upgrade the technology stack the company’s application was built on so they could quickly expand functionality using readily available plugins; therefore allowing rapid expansion of application functionality. The company also wanted to reduce the reliance on small, third-party vendors for this key component of corporate data.<br><br>
After evaluating many solutions, MAS selected two vendors to proceed with proof-of-concept applications: Salesforce and SugarCRM. The company selected a SugarCRM-based solution for its ability to integrate with legacy systems and handle fast customization. One of the many goals of the move was to develop in-house expertise to reduce ongoing customization and support costs. This seemed to be less achievable in Salesforce than in SugarCRM. Military AutoSource’s distributed sales force, with many face-to-face engagements, required the offline mobile capability in SugarCRM.<br><br>
In this session, Military AutoSource’s Director of IT, John Cannon, will discuss the company’s use of SugarCRM to manage the customer experience from lead to post-sale delivery, and provide examples of the highly customized user experience. John will reveal how and why the company is considering moving its premise-based SugarCRM deployment into the cloud for even faster and less complex integration, customization, and system maintenance.</p></div></td>

            <p>Military AutoSource (MAS) provides new, U.S. specification automobiles to active duty military, civilian, DOD employees, and the diplomatic community stationed outside the United States. The company operates more than 100 locations worldwide on U.S. Military bases and at stand-alone locations.<br><br> 
After deciding to replace an in-house MSSQL/VB lead management solution, MAS made the choice to move to a web-based platform that supports an integrated mobile solution. The goal was to upgrade the technology stack the company’s application was built on so they could quickly expand functionality using readily available plugins; therefore allowing rapid expansion of application functionality. The company also wanted to reduce the reliance on small, third-party vendors for this key component of corporate data.<br><br>
After evaluating many solutions, MAS selected two vendors to proceed with proof-of-concept applications: Salesforce and SugarCRM. The company selected a SugarCRM-based solution for its ability to integrate with legacy systems and handle fast customization. One of the many goals of the move was to develop in-house expertise to reduce ongoing customization and support costs. This seemed to be less achievable in Salesforce than in SugarCRM. Military AutoSource’s distributed sales force, with many face-to-face engagements, required the offline mobile capability in SugarCRM.<br><br>
In this session, Military AutoSource’s Director of IT, John Cannon, will discuss the company’s use of SugarCRM to manage the customer experience from lead to post-sale delivery, and provide examples of the highly customized user experience. John will reveal how and why the company is considering moving its premise-based SugarCRM deployment into the cloud for even faster and less complex integration, customization, and system maintenance.  </p>

<p>In business it’s not just what you know but also who you know that matters. Leveraging an organization’s collective relationship network can surface previously hidden and unexpected insights that organizations can use to improve sales performance, strengthen the customer journey and accelerate employee on boarding. Sugar is a world class way to manage customer relationships and touchpoints, however statistically less than 10% of customer communications data gets entered into any CRM. There can also be employees who communicate with customers but don’t have access to the CRM. This is where Relationship Analytics tools not only keep communication data current, but provide distinct advantages to the savvy sales executives who proactively interact with Sugar. Learn how Relationship Analytics for Sugar can reveal and leverage an organization’s collective social network. Hear from users how this has improved sales performance and increased adoption of Sugar. This session will also share how SugarCRM and its business partners are increasingly able to leverage TrustSphere’s relationship analytics platform as a ‘microservice’ to deliver real time insights embedded as part of their productivity and collaboration applications.

<p>For many industries such as automotive, financial services and other retail operations, the agent is the “front line” when it comes to the customer experience. However, often the tools offered to agents fail to truly capture the customer perspective. This can lead to a major gap between customer expectations and an agent’s ability to identify and solve issues along the customer journey. In this session, customer journey expert and CIAgenda founder Phil Winters will outline the value of empowering customer-facing agents to take the customer perspective, and provide some tips and tricks for optimizing the customer journey across these types of industries.

<p>Kroton, one of the largest for-profit higher education providers in South America, was facing some significant challenges. The volatile economy resulted in lower than expected student acquisition. This resulted in a change in strategic direction for Kroton – one focused on customer retention rather than acquisition.

On top of that, Kroton has even more plans to optimize retention by creating additional customer retention modules. In this session, Kroton’s Marketing Director Marcleo Mearim will reveal how Kroton was able to quickly change its strategic direction and improve retention efforts thanks to the flexibility of the Sugar platform.</p>

<p>Materion, a global leader in advanced materials serving multiple markets, had not changed its CRM system in two decades. But, when it wanted to transform its customer-facing operations on to a more modern and flexible platform – the project had an aggressive pace. From an initial pilot in late 2015, to a broader enterprise-wide rollout in 2016, Materion leveraged the flexibility of Sugar and its ecosystem to quickly create a rollout plan that would incorporate multiple geographies, languages, currencies, etc. And since Materion sells into multiple phases of the supply chain for markets like automotive electronics, aerospace, and consumer electronics – the sales process is complex, and maintaining strong relationships with multiple entities is critical. Materion’s Vice President of Sales Jason Maher will outline the drivers to Materion’s transformation, illustrating how Sugar provided the ideal platform for its aggressive rollout – and share insights into gaining strong adoption and effective change management along the way. </p>

            <p>A business transformation initiative typically involves multiple departments across the organization. Many of these department heads may be unfamiliar with CRM or have yet to see its impact in the organization. So when it’s time to expand and build more inclusive customer experience initiatives, it’s imperative to properly “sell” the business value of CRM as the foundational technology to internal stakeholders. This session will outline key strategies for presenting the business case for CRM to multiple audiences, citing examples of winning internal change management initiatives across multiple industries. </p>

As an initiative evolves, the scope, vision, and complexity of the project broadens—but so do the benefits. This session will outline the key stages of CRM maturity, what kinds of benefits each stage offers, and offer up some best practices for both identifying your organization’s current maturity level and how to advance to the next stage. </p>

If students take more than 4 years to complete an undergraduate degree, it increases their tuition fees and can decrease the university’s value proposition to prospective students. Fordham University has integrated a set of real-time indicators that present potential alerts around student lifecycle scenarios.
